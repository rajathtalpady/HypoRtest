# HypoRtest

This function performs multiple hypothesis tests on a random sample. The function takes several inputs, including the distribution to sample from, the sample size, the hypothesized mean, an optional second hypothesized mean for the difference in means test, and the significance level for the hypothesis tests. The function generates a random sample from the specified distribution and calculates the sample mean and standard deviation. It then performs a hypothesis test using a t-test and returns the result object.

If specified, the function can also perform additional hypothesis tests using a z-test and a test for the difference in means. The results of these additional tests are included in the result object.

Overall, this function is useful for performing hypothesis tests on random samples and comparing the results of different tests.
