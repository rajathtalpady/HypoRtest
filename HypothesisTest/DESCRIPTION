Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rajath Talpady
Maintainer: <rajatht@usf.edu>
Description: This package provides a function, HypoRtest(), which performs multiple hypothesis tests on a random sample drawn from one of four distributions: normal, uniform, exponential, or Poisson. 
The function uses a t-test to test whether the sample mean is equal to a hypothesized mean, and can also perform a z-test and a test for the difference in means if desired. 
The package is intended for use in educational settings to teach hypothesis testing concepts and techniques.
